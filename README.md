#Using keras with tensorflow for Edge detection in Images
This repository contains keras implementation of the ECNN (Edge detection CNN) discussed in the [paper] (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1708.03474.pdf). 

#Installation Dependencies:
* python 2 
* Keras and Tensorflow

#How to Run?
To train the network place train and test images under Data folder.
```
git clone https://github.com/murthy95/ECNN.git
cd ECNN
python ECNN.py 
```
